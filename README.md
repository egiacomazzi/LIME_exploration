# LIME_exploration

For an uni seminar I explored the Lime code behind the [LIME Library](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) to understand how LIME's mathematical grounds work. Text is used as the type of data. I broke down the object oriented programming way to have the ability to play around with the code. Some figures are added to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematics of the algorithm.
